/**
 * Regression suite for the reversal-split bug: a swipe that reverses direction
 * (u->i->n->i) is interrupted mid-reversal by the other thumb's tap. The
 * tap-split cuts the swipe at the raw sample nearest the tap, mid-travel
 * between keys, so the first half ended more than R_ENDPOINT_KW from its last
 * letter and failed the matcher's isEnd gate: "quindi" was pruned in the only
 * representable interleave, the decode was empty and the taps stayed as "QD".
 * Mirror image of the resume bug, which treated only the second half's start;
 * fixed by the symmetric softEnd relaxation on split first halves.

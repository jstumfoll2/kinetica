/**
 * The 40 bundled English contractions carried the frequency of their
 * apostrophe-less misspelling, on the assumption that the OpenSubtitles source
 * ships "dont"/"arent". It splits at the apostrophe and keeps the clitic as its
 * own entry ('t 9628970, 's 14291013), which WORD_RE rejects, so the mass stays
 * on the stem ("don" 4158644) while "dont" 9523 is only the typo count.
 *
 * Two separate mechanisms are locked here:
 *
 *  - Rank. A contraction at freq 163 has fw at the FREQ_WEIGHT_FLOOR, so any
 *    ordinary word sharing its path outranks it whatever the geometry says.
 *  - Tie. The apostrophe is transparent on the swipe path (zero path length in
 *    WordPredictor, skipped in the DtwMatcher ideal path), so a contraction and
 *    its misspelling decode at the same dTotal. Copying the frequency made their
 *    scores equal too: 32 exact ties broken by heap order alone.
 *
 * The completion path is not asserted as a win: there the apostrophe costs a
 * full COMPLETION_PENALTY_PER_LETTER the bare spelling does not pay, worth
 * geo(0.50)/geo(0.25) = 1.98x, and the frequency repair buys only 1.61x of it.
 * See [contractionCompletionStaysPickable].

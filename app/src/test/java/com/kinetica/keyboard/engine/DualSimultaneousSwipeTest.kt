/**
 * Regression suite for dual-thumb words where the two streams interleave,
 * which the single-cut merge generators could not represent.
 *
 * The fixtures' timings are transcribed from a device capture, so these are the
 * real failures. Path geometry is synthetic: the trace records token intervals
 * but no coordinates, so the swipe letters are inferred from the target word
 * minus the tapped letters, in order, the only reconstruction the data admits.
 *
 * Two mechanisms are covered:
 *  - "cuando": one swipe needing cuts at two interior cross-stream taps. The
 *    tap-split generator inserted one tap per sequence, so the representable
 *    orders were cuno|a|d, cu|a|no|d and cun|a|d|o, and the last spells
 *    c,u,n,a,d,o, the word that won on device ("cuñado", d=0.59). c,u,a,n,d,o
 *    was never a candidate.
 *  - partial overlap: two swipes where the second starts inside the first but
 *    ends after it, what two thumbs moving at once produce. The
 *    swipe-around-swipe generator required strict containment on both sides.

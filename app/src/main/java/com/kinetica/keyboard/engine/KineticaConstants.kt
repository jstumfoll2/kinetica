    // changed after the first ship: the boost became CONDITIONED ON THE FIT, the
    // way the personal boost is - both go through appliedBoost below - and the
    // cap came down from 1.5.
    //
    // Lowered 2026-08-18, and the measurement is why it is 1.0 and not something
    // between. Over 219 final-buffer rows from the three captures taken under the
    // current formula, EVERY cap in [0.5, 1.0] moves exactly one top-1 - the
    // `her`/`here` row that item 16 had left open, where `here` fits 0.31 against
    // `her`'s 0.54 and loses to a bigram of 2.19 raw. The plateau is twice as wide
    // as the change, so this is not a knife edge; 1.0 is its top, i.e. the least
    // change that reaches the fix. Below 0.5 real regressions start (3 rows at
    // 0.25, 5 at 0.0) and above 1.0 the fix is not reached at all.
    //
    // Two rows that also move at 1.0 are NOT costs, and checking that mechanically
    // rather than by eye is what made the result readable: `decode out` fires once
    // per pointer lift, so a row whose token list is a strict prefix of the next
    // row's is a word still being drawn. Both were - one grows a second swipe and
    // becomes `solte`, the other grows two taps and becomes `held`. The surviving
    // row's intent is proved outright: the next decode is tap[h] tap[e] tap[r]
    // tap[e], the word being re-typed by hand.
    //
    // The population is those three captures alone, deliberately. Six of the
    // eleven predate the score formula that ships today and four predate the fit
    // conditioning, so their printed boosts came from rules that no longer exist;
    // recovering raw values from them means inverting three superseded rules in
    // sequence, which is exactly the step that once credited a change with fixes
    // that had already been made.
    //
    // Why it needed conditioning at all. The byte is normalized per previous
    // word against that word's own maximum (BigramTable.build), so the argmax
    // continuation of EVERY prev word quantizes to 255 and earns the full 2.5x:
    // the ceiling is routine, not theoretical, and it is larger than any
    // personal boost observed on a device. Once the geometric term was capped
    // and the personal boost conditioned, this was the last unbounded,
    // unconditioned factor in the product, and it took two "mujer" gestures to
    // "me" with pb=1.0 on the winner (me d=0.90 bm=1.96 against mujer d=0.40).
    //
    // Measured over ten device captures, 557 decode rows with >= 2
    // candidates. Two method points, because the first measurement got them
    // wrong and the corrected one changes the answer:
    //  - Six captures predate the saturating geometric term and four predate
    //    the conditioned personal boost, so their printed `s` came from a
    //    formula that no longer ships. The baseline must be RE-RANKED under the
    //    current formula first (the `sat` inversion
    //    ScoreWeightingTest.shippedScore already does); 110 of the 557 rows rank
    //    differently today than their capture shows. Regating the printed
    //    ranking instead credits this rule with rows those two earlier changes
    //    had already fixed: state>sudare and the>there belong to the saturating
    //    term, close>computer to the conditioned personal boost.
    //  - The condition must read geoFit, not dTotal. Measured consequence: none,
    //    and that is worth knowing rather than assuming. All 82 candidates
    //    carrying bm > 1 past the cap are SWIPE (78) or MERGED (4), and the
    //    source precedence in WordPredictor.emit puts FUZZY_TAP ahead of both,
    //    so those rows carry no tap penalty and geoFit == dTotal exactly. ZERO
    //    tap or completion candidates carry a bigram past the cap.
    //
    // Why the shape is a fade and not an outright drop past the cap. A hard
    // gate moves 10 tops and fixes four flagship rows, but it loses a real
    // "sempre" gesture at d=0.55 - five hundredths past the cap, carried
    // entirely by bm=1.91 against "stremo" at 0.45. That is the documented cost
    // of dropping a boost outright ("a reinforced poor fit loses its rescue")
    // landing on a resume-family flagship on real thumbs. Below a retained
    // fraction of ~0.20 a flat retention also promotes the proper noun "connor"
    // over "come" on the very path where the guard forbids exactly that, and
    // neither word is the intended one there. Sweeping a flat retained fraction
    // k of the boost above 1:
    //   k      0.05-0.13   0.14-0.18   0.20-0.32   >= 0.34
    //   moves      8           7        6 (chosen)     4
    //   loses   sempre    connor row       -            -
    // The plateau is 1.6x wide. Compressing the boost EVERYWHERE (bm^b) is a
    // different thing and stays rejected - it reaches 2 rows only at b ~ 0.1,
    // which deletes context prediction (see GEO_EXPONENT above).
    //
    // boostWeight subsumes that sweep rather than contradicting it: k above was
    // the value the boost needed AT d=0.55, its blocker row, and the fade gives
    // 0.79 there - so the sweep's constraint is satisfied with room. What the
    // fade changes is the two ends. It applies no constant from the cap
    // outward, so a bigram on a HOPELESS fit is gone rather than merely reduced,
    // and that is what fixes the residual a flat retention leaves behind: with
    // every candidate's boost at zero past one key hop, an all-saturated row
    // falls through to fw and "nosotros" - the highest fw in that row - finally
    // leads it. Past the cap it is fw that ought to decide, and the fade is what
    // lets it, one window further out.
    //
    // The ratio guarantee is strengthened by the fade, not lost. An affine
    // retention COMPRESSES the ratio between two saturated candidates toward 1
    // rather than preserving it, which makes it weaker than the personal
    // boost's rule; under a weight that reaches zero, two candidates past one
    // key hop have their boosts erased outright and the ratio is preserved
    // again. In between, the compression is monotone in the fit, so the rule
    // still can never move a contest away from the better fit
    // (ScoreWeightingTest.theBigramConditionNeverFavoursTheWorseFit).
    const val BIGRAM_BOOST_MAX = 1.0f

    // Geometric term of the candidate score:
    //   score = fw * geometricTerm(dTotal) * bigram * personalBoost
    //
    // This was previously a bare 1/(1+d), which varies only 1.0 -> 0.4
    // across the useful distance range while fw*bm*pb spans ~3x. A frequent,
    // context-boosted or personally-reinforced word with mediocre shape
    // therefore outranked a near-perfect fit: "the" (d=0.56) beat "there"
    // (d=0.22), "state" beat "sudare" (d=0.18), "come" beat "computer".
    //
    // Two parameters, and the SATURATION is what makes the fix possible at
    // all. Sharpening alone cannot work: the opposing constraint is that
    // "sarei" (d=1.06) must keep beating "sergei" (d=0.59) on frequency, and
    // on the measured numbers that caps any pure 1/(1+d)^g at g < 1.06 - below
    // the g >= 1.44 the "sudare" row needs. The two demands are jointly
    // infeasible for every unbounded monotone function of d (measured on both
    // the device captures and their reconstructions; exp(-d/tau) fails
    // identically, being the same one-parameter trade).
    //
    // What separates them is WHERE the intended word sits. Every target of the
    // first group is a good fit losing to a poor one (d 0.15-0.33 vs 0.4-1.0);
    // "sarei" is the opposite, a poor fit that must win on frequency (d=1.06).
    // So: a good geometric fit is informative and is scored steeply, and past
    // GEO_SATURATION_KW a fit carries no further information - a d=0.6 match
    // and a d=1.5 match are both "this is not the shape you drew" - and
    // frequency decides among them, which is exactly what carries "sarei".

    // 3.75/0.50 sits inside a broad plateau rather than on a knife edge
    // (0.45-0.60 x 2.5-4.0 is monotone and regression-free), which is why it
    // is trusted; the greedier 5.00 rows were left on the table because the
    // gain past 3.75 is all reconstruction rows whose device twins are
    // already fixed, and a steeper term buys nothing on real geometry.
    // 0.50 kw is also just above R_ENDPOINT_KW/3 and well under the 1.0 kw
    // key hop, i.e. "still inside the intended key" is the informative zone.

    // Compressing the bigram and personal boosts instead (bm^b, pb^b) was

    // all four targets and 7 of 8 protected rows. That is 3.3x wide - twice
    // BIGRAM_BOOST_MAX's plateau - and the shipped width sits inside it.
    //
    // The width is 1.0 because that is the only value with an anchor rather
    // than a fit: the fade completes at 2 * GEO_SATURATION_KW = 1.0 kw, one
    // whole key, the unit every geometric constant in this file is written in.
    // A candidate a full key away from what was drawn is not a candidate the
    // gesture has any opinion about, so nothing it carries should be believed.
    //
    // The one protected row that moves is undetermined by the captures rather
    // than lost: one "computer" over "come" row wins by 0.8% today and loses by
    // 0.5% after, and fw prints truncated to 2 dp, so the true ratio straddles
    // the verdict under BOTH formulas. Rows that fail that test are excluded
    // from the acceptance set instead of tuned against - the same discipline
    // that keeps reconstructions out of ranking fixtures. The same contest with
    // a real margin, elsewhere in the capture, holds under both.
    //
    // Rows the fade moves and the gate did not, beyond the four targets: five
    // where the better fit takes the row from a bigram-carried worse one
    // (he->her, ne->me x2, llego->llevo, visto->chiamato), and one cost -
    // "mo"(d=0.45, pb=1.29) loses to "no"(d=0.68, pb=1.57). That row is the
    // intent-unverifiable class this file declines to write goldens from (a
    // stray RIGHT-swipe fragment whose contacts never touched "n"), and it is
    // decided, not noise. It is the price of restoring the boost at
    // d=0.68, which is also what wins "sempre" at 0.60 - the two sit 0.08 kw
    // apart with boosts within 2% of each other, so no width separates them.
    // The same interleaving of populations that ruled out a dwell-duration
    // threshold and an earlier language-detect margin.
    //
    // Three known limitations, recorded rather than left to be rediscovered.
    // (1) It trades "personal history can overrule geometry" for "geometry
    // overrules personal history once the fit stops carrying information", and
    // the rows where the boost earns its keep are exactly the rows where the
    // intended word fits badly ("sarei" at d=1.06 must beat "sergei" at 0.59,
    // while "atei" at 0.377 sits inside the cap). The fade softens this rather
    // than removing it: a reinforced word just past the cap keeps most of its
    // rescue, and only one a whole key away loses all of it.
    // (2) THE STEP EDGE, which the earlier gate had and boostWeight fixes. The
    // gate was discontinuous at the cap where geometricTerm is not, so a
    // candidate at 0.49 and the same candidate at 0.51 differed by the whole
    // boost, and a device capture caught it deciding "sempre" four times. The
    // obvious linear ramp is NOT the answer and measurement is what showed it:
    // scaling by 1 - min(dGeo, cap)/cap dilutes GOOD fits too (a d=0.30 word
    // keeps 40%), which re-broke the device-verified "mujer" row. What works is
    // to leave the in-cap boost alone - so every saturating-term contest, every
    // tap decode and twentyCommitsFlipTheRanking are byte-identical - and fade
    // only the excess. See boostWeight.
    // (3) A boost past one whole key hop is zero rather than merely small,
    // which is what lets an all-saturated row fall to fw. That is deliberate
    // and is how the "nosotros" row was finally won, but it means a heavily
    // reinforced word can no longer rescue a gesture that landed on different
    // keys at all. If that ever costs a real word, the lever is the fade WIDTH
    // (the plateau runs 0.75-2.5 in units of GEO_SATURATION_KW), not a return
    // to a threshold.
    //
    // Note the badge in the suggestion bar still reports the raw count, so a
    // heavily reinforced word can show seven dots and not move: reinforcement
    // no longer buys rank for a poor fit.

    //
    // Why nothing replaced them:
    //
    // 1. No cross-dictionary frequency normalization is needed. freqByteFor
    //    already log-quantizes each asset against its OWN maximum count, and
    //    the five bundled assets are the same construction (hermitdave
    //    FrequencyWords top-50k, OpenSubtitles), so fw at matched rank
    //    percentiles agrees to within 1.04-1.07x across en/it/es/pl/cs
    //    (measured: p50 0.5265/0.5265/0.5382/0.5471/0.5441,
    //    p99 0.4706/0.4706/0.4882/0.5029/0.5000). Nine assets ship now and the
    //    spread across all nine is 1.20x at p50, Norwegian the outlier at 0.456;
    //    that one is not yet priced. Against relative corpus frequency
    //    the spread remains small. geometricTerm moves 1.335x between d=0.25
    //    and d=0.35, so the residual asset bias is worth under 0.025 kw of
    //    distance - an order of
    //    magnitude below what decides any ranking. The roadmap's stated risk
    //    ("the larger asset wins everything") does not materialize here, and
    //    would have to be re-measured only for an asset built differently -
    //    an AOSP-merged import (DictionaryStore.wordlistOverride) is the one
    //    shipped path that can produce one.
    // 2. Had normalization been needed it could only be a per-language
    //    MULTIPLICATIVE constant. The score is a product, so percentile-rank
    //    or z-score remapping of fw reorders candidates WITHIN a language and
    //    would move every geometric-term golden; a constant factor cannot.
    //    Measured on the device rows, the good and bad merge outcomes overlap
    //    in score ratio (1.006-1.31 against 1.006-1.10), so no such constant
    //    separates them either - the same interleaving of populations that
    //    ruled out a dwell-duration threshold and the confidence ratio below.
    // 3. The one bound the merge does use is GEO_SATURATION_KW, borrowed from
    //    the score's own geometric term rather than tuned: a foreign candidate
    //    may lead only while its fit still carries geometric information.

    // --- languages, and any future attempt has to start from it
    //
    // Both values HELD at their last re-derivation, which re-swept them against
    // the search-budget recall fix (that fix moves the gate's only operand - the
    // active language's best fit - so the previous sweep had measured a decoder
    // that was starving the active language). 91 decodes this time: 48
    // synthetic Italian rows, 28 synthetic Spanish-only rows, and 15 rows
    // rebuilt from the `keys=` contacts of the three device captures. The third
    // population is new and it is the one that matters, because it refuted the
    // previous derivation's central claim.
    //
    // 1. MARGIN 1.15 is held, and it is now known to be near its floor, not
    //    comfortably above a clean gap:
    //      - synthetic same-language rows still ceiling at exactly 1.000 (a word
    //        bundled in both dictionaries gets identical geometry from both);
    //      - but DEVICE-reconstructed same-language geometry reaches 1.095 (the
    //        `siete` gesture: Spanish "suerte" d=0.188 fits the recorded real
    //        path better than Italian "siete" d=0.301), because on a real path
    //        the active language's best fit is usually NOT the intended word;
    //      - and the foreign population reaches DOWN to 1.000 on the same
    //        device paths (ayudarte 1.000-1.100, cuando 1.015).
    //    So the two populations overlap in [1.000, 1.095]: no threshold
    //    separates them. Lowering the margin to catch the ayudarte/cuando class
    //    would hand `siete` back to Spanish - one of the three failures this
    //    gate was written to fix. 1.15 keeps every measured same-language row
    //    safe and detects 23 of 38 foreign rows; the missing 15 are a design
    //    limit of single-gesture detection between two Romance languages, and
    //    the answer was the merged ranking, not this constant.
    // 2. LOW_CONF 0.85 is held, and the sweep is blunt about what it does: in all
    //    53 same-language rows it is NEVER the binding gate - the margin (or the
    //    isWord veto) blocks every one of them - while it costs 4 genuine
    //    detections at 0.75 and 1 more at 0.85 ("ahora", pConf 0.852, ratio
    //    1.173). Active-language best-fit d still does not separate the
    //    populations (same-language 0.000-0.387, foreign 0.132-1.086 - they
    //    interleave, exactly as dwell duration does), so it must not be
    //    asked to discriminate. It stays as the cheap veto for the case the
    //    sweep never produced but the design assumes: a foreign-looking path the
    //    active language explains near-exactly. Raising it past ~0.9 is pointless
    //    anyway - an exact active-language match gives pConf 1.0, which no margin
    //    above 1.0 can beat, so the top end is self-protecting.

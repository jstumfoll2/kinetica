     * Ranks the active and other language's candidates into one list.
     *
     * A whole-list swap asked which language a word is in and could not answer: on device
     * geometry the same-language and foreign confidence ratios overlap in [1.000, 1.095], and a
     * wrong answer discarded the right word. Ranking together needs no such answer. Scores are
     * comparable across the bundled dictionaries (Trie.freqByteFor normalises each asset to its
     * own maximum; see the cross-language note in [KineticaConstants]), so no cross-dictionary
     * normalisation is applied.
     *
     * Two provenance rules, neither a tuned threshold:
     *
     * 1. A candidate of the other language whose exact spelling the active dictionary holds is
     *    dropped. A shared word carries no cross-language information, and keeping it would
     *    re-rank an active word by foreign frequency (`sergei` is in both lists and used to beat
     *    `sarei`). The dedup below is the defensive remainder.
     * 2. A foreign candidate may lead, becoming the tentative a delimiter commits, only on
     *    positive geometric evidence:
     *      a. the active language produced a candidate: an empty active decode says the gesture
     *         was undecodable, not which language it was in, and `patéale` came from there. With
     *         none, a swiped fit under [KineticaConstants.NO_NATIVE_LEAD_KW] still leads;
     *      b. its own fit carries information, `dtwDistance < GEO_SATURATION_KW`, the score's
     *         own bound: past it a d=0.6 and a d=1.5 match both say "not the shape you drew";
     *      c. it fits strictly better than the active language's best fit. An equal fit is not
     *         evidence: `interesante` (es) and `interessante` (it) both decode at d=0.000, since
     *         a doubled letter shares its ideal path (DtwMatcherTest), and the Italian word
     *         would lose its own gesture to a 0.8% frequency difference. Free on 110 device rows;
     *      d. for a tapped word ([tapOnly]), it is at least as frequent as the active lead; see
     *         [tapLeadAllowed].
     *
     * A demoted foreign candidate stays in the list and stays pickable, so a wrong lead is
     * recoverable. On 110 language decisions replayed from device captures 12 top-1 change, all
     * foreign words the swap missed (`ayudarte` x5, `mujer` x3, `cuando` x2, `nosotros`), and no
     * other row moves.
     *
     * Internal so the decision stays unit-testable with captured candidate tuples
     * (LanguagePreferenceTest).

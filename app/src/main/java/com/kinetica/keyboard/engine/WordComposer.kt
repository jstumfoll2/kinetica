     * of 10 real foreign words). Worse, a wrong answer was unrecoverable - the
     * active language's candidates were discarded, so the right word was not
     * even pickable and the word had to be retyped by hand.
     *
     * Ranking them together needs no such answer, and no threshold. Scores are
     * already comparable across the bundled dictionaries: Trie.freqByteFor
     * normalizes each asset against its OWN maximum count, and the first five
     * assets are the same construction (FrequencyWords top-50k), so fw at
     * matched rank percentiles agrees to within 1.04-1.07x - worth under
     * 0.025 kw of distance against a geometric term that moves 1.335x between
     * d=0.25 and d=0.35. Across the nine that ship now the spread is 1.20x at
     * p50: Norwegian sits at 0.456 against English 0.527, on a far smaller
     * source corpus. Not yet priced. No cross-dictionary frequency normalization is
     * applied because none is needed, and any that were would have to be a
     * per-language MULTIPLICATIVE constant: score is a product, so a
     * percentile or z-score remap reorders candidates WITHIN a language and
     * would move the geometric-term goldens.
     *
     * Two provenance rules, neither of them a tuned threshold:
     *
     * 1. A candidate of the other language whose word the ACTIVE dictionary
     *    already holds is DROPPED. This is the isWord veto applied per
     *    candidate instead of to the list head: a shared word carries no
     *    cross-language information, and keeping it would re-rank an
     *    active-language word by foreign frequency ("sergei" is in both
     *    wordlists, and importing the Spanish entry is exactly how the swap
     *    used to lose the intended "sarei"). In production it also removes
     *    every duplicate, since a predictor can only emit words its own trie
     *    holds; the dedup below is the defensive remainder.
     * 2. A foreign candidate may LEAD - i.e. become the tentative the editor
     *    shows and a delimiter commits - only on positive geometric evidence,
     *    which is three conditions and no threshold of its own:
     *      a. the active language produced at least one candidate. An empty
     *         active decode is evidence the gesture was undecodable, not
     *         evidence about language - this is the rule that stops a
     *         hopeless decode committing a foreign word, and it is where
     *         "patéale" used to come from;
     *      b. its own fit still carries geometric information,
     *         `dtwDistance < GEO_SATURATION_KW`. The bound is the score's
     *         own, reused rather than invented: past the cap a d=0.6 and a d=1.5 match are
     *         both "this is not the shape you drew";
     *      c. it fits STRICTLY better than the active language's best fit -
     *         a like-with-like comparison, applied to promotion. An
     *         equal fit is not evidence: "interesante" (es) and
     *         "interessante" (it) decode at exactly d=0.000 on the same path,
     *         because a doubled letter shares its ideal path after
     *         consecutive-duplicate dedup (DtwMatcherTest), so without this
     *         clause the flagship Italian word loses its own gesture to a 0.8%
     *         frequency difference. The same class as "rese"/"reese", across
     *         languages. Measured free: the 110 device rows produce the same
     *         12 promotions with and without it.
     *
     *      d. for a tapped word ([tapOnly]), it is at least as frequent as the
     *         active language's lead; see [tapLeadAllowed].
     *
     * Geometry is the ONLY evidence that a word belongs to another language,
     * so a foreign candidate that offers none has nothing to promote it.
     *
     * A demoted foreign candidate is not removed, only overtaken - it stays in
     * the list and stays pickable, which is what makes a wrong lead
     * recoverable rather than fatal.
     *
     * Measured on 110 language decisions replayed from device captures: 12
     * top-1 changes, all 12 of them detection misses of the old gate being
     * fixed (ayudarte x5, cuando x2, mujer x3,
     * nosotros), and no other row moves. Rule 2 suppresses exactly the rows
     * where both languages are past the cap and the contest is pure frequency
     * ("juntos" at d=1.7 over "leonard"), plus the two empty-Italian "parlare"
     * decodes that used to commit "patéale".

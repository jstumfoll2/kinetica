 * A swipe gesture. Carries both the resampled raw path (DTW input: quantizing
 * to key centers would destroy the corner geometry that separates near-tie
 * words) and the hysteresis-deduped key contacts (pruning and UI callbacks).
 *
 * [softStart] marks the second half of a mid-swipe split (see
 * MergeAlternatives.splitSwipe): such a half resumes mid-word after a rest, so
 * its first letter may sit anywhere along the resumed path rather than at the
 * path's start point, and the matcher relaxes its start-letter gate accordingly.
 *
 * [softEnd] is the symmetric flag on the first half of a split: the cut lands
 * at the raw sample nearest the interrupting tap, which is mid-travel whenever
 * the thumb was moving when the other thumb tapped ("quindi"), so the half's
 * last letter may sit anywhere along its path, and the matcher relaxes its
 * end-letter gate.
 *
 * [dwells] are the pauses GestureStream observed inside this gesture, in time
 * order. Populated for whole gestures only; split halves inherit none, since
 * their boundaries are explicit. The decode path does not read this directly:
 * DecodeTrace reports the on-device dwell timings, and the merge uses them as
 * a secondary cut source.

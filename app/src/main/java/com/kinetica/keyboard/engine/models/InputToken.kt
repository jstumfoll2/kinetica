 * DWELL_RADIUS_KW of its first sample for at least DWELL_MIN_MS, so its start
 * may sit up to that radius before the pointer fully settled (and its end the
 * same distance into the resumed leg). That imprecision is harmless by

 * A swipe gesture. Carries both the resampled raw path (DTW input: quantizing
 * to key centers would destroy the corner geometry that separates near-tie
 * words) and the hysteresis-deduped key contacts (pruning and UI callbacks).
 *
 * [softStart] marks the second half of a mid-swipe split (see
 * MergeAlternatives.splitSwipe): such a half resumes mid-word after a rest, so
 * its first letter may sit anywhere along the resumed path rather than at the
 * path's start point, and the matcher relaxes its start-letter gate accordingly.
 *
 * [softEnd] is the symmetric flag on the FIRST half of a split: the cut lands
 * at the raw sample nearest the interrupting tap, which is mid-travel whenever
 * the thumb was moving when the other thumb tapped ("quindi"), so the half's
 * last letter may sit anywhere along its path rather
 * than at the cut point, and the matcher relaxes its end-letter gate.
 *
 * [dwells] are the pauses GestureStream observed inside this gesture, in time
 * order. Populated for whole gestures only (split halves inherit none - their
 * boundaries are already explicit). The decode path does not read this
 * directly: it exists so DecodeTrace can report real on-device dwell timings,
 * and so the merge can use them as a secondary cut source.

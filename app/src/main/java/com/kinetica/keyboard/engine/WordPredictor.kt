 * One line per commit naming, per letter of the committed word and in word order, how

 *
 * The third iteration of the near-miss instrument and the first one that is aimed. The
 * first reported every key within R_INNER_KW of a piece and named 4 to 15 of them per
 * piece; the second added distances and saturated, 128 of 152 lists full at the cap of
 * six, which measures how crowded a QWERTY neighbourhood is. Both asked about keys. The
 * question is about the letters of a NAMED word, and the name is something only the
 * developer can supply, which they do by retyping until the word commits. So the label
 * arrives free at commit time, and the population it labels is 254 of 570 labelled
 * buffers that never touch some letter of their own word, 158 of them missing one.
 *
 * Two things make it answer what the earlier iterations could not:
 *
 *  - **Per occurrence, not per key.** `praticamente` needs `a` twice and the trace could
 *    not say so, because `a` was contacted once and was therefore absent from a per-key
 *    list of what was missed.
 *  - **In order.** Each occurrence is credited only to a contact at or after the previous
 *    occurrence's, so a letter the thumb reached only too early is marked rather than
 *    credited. That is the other half of that reading: the left thumb held `t` at 256 ms
 *    and reached `a` only at 607.
 *
 * Distances come off the real resampled path. A reconstruction through contact centres
 * cannot answer this, and the measurement saying so is emphatic: all 414 never-contacted
 * letter instances read "near the path" at a median 1.00 kw when measured that way.
 *
 * Format, one token per letter occurrence: `<letter><piece>:<kw>@<index>` for the closest
 * the path ever came, plus a mark: `!` a contact at or after the previous occurrence's,
 * `=` the second of a doubled letter sharing one contact, `<` contacted but only earlier
 * than this occurrence needs, and nothing at all for a letter no thumb ever touched.
 * `note=seeded` or `note=unrelated` flags a line whose buffer is not the word's gesture.
 *
 * Those two marks are the two mechanisms the attribution pass counts, per occurrence
 * instead of per buffer: `missing=` is the letter no thumb ever touched, 75% of the
 * inadmissible bucket, and `back=` is the letter touched in the wrong order, which is
 * most of the rest. Neither needs a threshold, which is why the order mark is
 * contact-based rather than a distance comparison: with 32 resample points there is
 * always some index left to match against, so a "no candidate" test would never fire.

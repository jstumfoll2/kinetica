An open-source (GPL-3.0) Android keyboard built for **two thumbs at once**. Each thumb swipes or
taps on its own, at the same time as the other, and both streams merge into one word. A spiritual
successor to the discontinued Nintype (also known as Keyboard69), written from scratch on Android's
public IME APIs: no fork, no third-party gesture library.

**No network permission.** Nothing you type can leave the phone. Decoding, prediction and learning
run on the device; password and private fields turn off suggestions, trails and learning.

Typing SOMETHING:

- the left thumb taps `S`, then `E`;
- the right thumb swipes `O -> M`, then `T -> H -> I -> N -> G`, overlapping in time;
- Kinetica merges `S + OM + E + THING` into "something".

## Install

[<img src="https://f-droid.org/badge/get-it-on.png" alt="Get it on F-Droid" height="80">](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.kinetica.keyboard/)

F-Droid is the recommended channel: it updates in the background and verifies the build. A new
version reaches it a few days after it is tagged here.

Or take `kinetica-<version>.apk` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/EZ-eta/kinetica/releases/latest):

```bash
adb install -r kinetica-*.apk
```

Then open the Kinetica icon and follow the three steps. A debug build has a different signing key,
so Android refuses to upgrade it: back up first (Settings > Backup), then uninstall it.

Release APKs are signed with the project's key by the tagged
[release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml), so the build behind every APK is public.
F-Droid ships Kinetica as a [reproducible build](https://f-droid.org/docs/Reproducible_Builds): it
rebuilds the tag, checks its output against the APK above and publishes the same signature. Either
channel can install and update over the other.

## Features

### Two thumbs

- Two independent swipe/tap streams, one per thumb, merged by contact time. Each thumb is read with
  its own cursor, so a word can go back and forth between them in any order.
- A tap from one thumb inside the other's swipe can double a letter (`h-e-l-o` swipe + `l` tap is
  "hello"), and one tap can stand for a doubled letter (`ottima`, `tutti`).
- Swipe decoding written from scratch: banded dynamic time warping over resampled paths, an anchored
  trie search, frequency and word-pair context.
- Practise two thumbs (Settings > Learn Kinetica): five words drawn over the keyboard, thumb by
  thumb, typed in a practice field.

### Suggestions

- Up to ten candidates; a page holds as many as fit, and the bar swipes sideways to the next one.
  Flick a word up to put it in at once.
- After a commit the bar becomes a correction strip: tap another word and it replaces the one just
  written, taking its learned weight with it.
- Next-word suggestions while nothing is being typed (Typing, on).
- Recent words: the last two words stay on the bar, each with the words it beat; tap one to swap it
  in (off by default).
- A tapped word with one stray or one missing letter is offered on the bar, never changed for you.
- Tap completions mid-word (`t-h` offers "the", "they"); the letters you typed are always the last
  zone, so a word the dictionary lacks goes in with one tap.
- Tap autocorrect with three levels. It restores missing accents (`perche` -> `perché`,
  `pozno` -> `późno`), and backspace right after it puts back what you typed.
- A retype button (off by default) takes the word back, and the bar then offers what else the
  gesture could have been.

### Editing

- Tap inside a word you wrote and the bar offers what it had when you wrote it, then the word's
  spelling neighbours; a pick replaces the whole word.
- Backspace to the end of a word to keep working on it with taps or swipes.
- Slide along the spacebar to move the cursor, by letter or by word.
- Slide left from backspace to mark words for deletion; slide back to keep them, lift to delete.
- Hold shift for `abc`, `Abc` or `ABC` on the word at the cursor or on selected text.
- Enter searches, sends or goes where the app asks for it, and its label says which; hold it for a
  new line (Typing, on).
- Tidy spaces: never two spaces in a row and none before a closing quote (Typing > Spacing, off).

### Shortcuts

- Chords: hold `?123` or the spacebar and tap a key. Each chord picks its trigger, so `?123`+`l` and
  space+`l` are two chords. Defaults: `?123`+`l` switches language, `?123`+`p` toggles peck-type;
  both can be removed.
- Edge swipes: swipe off any key in any direction. Defaults: backspace up `!`, enter up `?`.
- Text expansions: a short trigger becomes longer text, fired by the Expand action. A trigger can
  have several targets, picked on the bar, and targets can chain.
- A chord, an edge swipe or an expansion can type text, run an action (paste, copy, undo, Tab, the
  arrows, Home, End, Esc, forward delete, the date) or press Ctrl and a key (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+Del).
- Shortcuts on the bar when there is nothing to suggest, and in the `?123` hold menu; both sets are
  chosen and ordered in Typing > Suggestion bar.
- Settings from the keyboard: hold `?123` and slide onto the gear.

### Keys and layout

- Long-press menus on every letter and punctuation key: a row or a 3x3, 4x3 or 5x3 grid. Each
  letter's list can be edited, filled from every enabled language with Default, or given a shortcut
  (`:paste`). Swipe up on the top row, or down on the bottom row, for the key's corner character.
- Numbers row above the letters (Keys, off). The keyboard grows so the letters keep their size.
- Middle row width (Size and layout): spreads `a s d f g h j k l` toward the edges, for hands used to
  a board without the half-key indent.
- Layout modes: full width, right, left, split, one-handed. Landscape has its own height and can be
  split to the edges, centred or full width.
- Height by dragging the handle above the bar, side and bottom margins, a live size preview.
- An optional apostrophe key right of `L`, for `don't` or `nell'immagine` without the symbols page.
- Two symbol pages and a numpad; a configurable comma and period key; an emoji picker on the
  comma's long-press, with a frequently used tab.
- Words per minute on the spacebar while you type (Keys, off).
- Themes: dark, light, Material You, or a palette from one colour of your choice. Zen mode turns
  animations off.

### Languages

- English, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Czech, Dutch, German, French and Norwegian; Russian, Ukrainian,
  Hebrew and Arabic are experimental, each with its own board. 46k to 50k words per language with
  real corpus frequencies, and up to 100k word pairs.
- Switch with a chord without leaving the field; the active language shows on the spacebar.
- Accented words are drawn on their base keys and come out with their accents. A spelling with the
  accents left off is offered only where written text uses it: `pojsc` corrects to `pójść`, while
  `ze` and `że` both stay.
- Mix enabled languages: the active language and the next enabled one in one list (Languages > More
  language options, off).
- Follow the language I type: up to three languages as equals, the one you are typing weighs most
  (same screen, off, experimental).
- British spelling for English.
- A language is data plus registration, so new ones can be contributed:
  [ADDING_A_LANGUAGE.md](ADDING_A_LANGUAGE.md).

### Learning and privacy

- Every committed word earns weight for its language; a word you keep choosing outranks a more
  common one. Hold a suggestion and slide up or down to change its weight, one badge tier per step;
  slide past the lowest tier to block it.
- Phrase learning (optional): which word you tend to type after which.
- Dictionary: learned and blocked words per language, with search; import of an AOSP word list,
  merged on the phone.
- Backup: every setting, learned word and shortcut in one text file, restored with progress, and
  the last restore can be undone.
- Settings in English and Italian, by the phone's language or Android 13's per-app language;
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) says how to add a translation.
- Learn Kinetica in Settings: the two-thumb practice, then short tips from the basics up.

## Worth a look in Settings

- **Get rid of a word for good.** Hold it on the bar and slide past the lowest tier, or add it in
  Settings > Dictionary > *Blocked words*. A blocked word is never offered again and never learned
  back.
- **Peck-type mode** turns off swiping, suggestions and autocorrect, so every tap types exactly its
  letter. For slang, codes and anything the dictionary keeps fighting.
- **Automatic spaces after tapped words too.** Typing > Spacing > *Autospace tapped words too*. A
  word the dictionary holds gets its space after a pause, and the next letter takes it back if the
  word was not over. Three sliders set the delays.
- **A shorter keyboard.** *Keyboard height* goes down to 10% of the screen, *Suggestion bar height*
  shrinks the bar and its text, and *Resize handle height* at 0 removes the grip.
- **Long-press without the accents.** *Hide accented letters on long-press* leaves digits and
  symbols, for languages whose alphabet does not use accents.
- **A much bigger dictionary.** Settings > Dictionary > *Import improved dictionary* takes an AOSP
  `wordlist.combined` and merges it with the bundled list, three to five times the words. Get the
  `main_<code>.combined` file for your language from
  [aosp-dictionaries](https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries) under `wordlists/`.
- **Search the settings** with the icon at the top; it knows several words for each setting.

## Requirements

- JDK 17
- Android SDK: platform 34, build-tools 34.0.0 (the command-line tools are enough)
- Gradle 8.7 through the bundled wrapper
- minSdk 26 (Android 8.0), targetSdk 34

### Toolchain from zero (macOS, Homebrew)

```bash
brew install openjdk@17
brew install --cask android-commandlinetools
export JAVA_HOME="$(brew --prefix openjdk@17)/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home"
export ANDROID_HOME="$(brew --prefix)/share/android-commandlinetools"
yes | sdkmanager --sdk_root="$ANDROID_HOME" --licenses
sdkmanager --sdk_root="$ANDROID_HOME" "platform-tools" "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0"
echo "sdk.dir=$ANDROID_HOME" > local.properties
```

On Linux or Windows, any JDK 17 and the Android command-line tools work the same way: install
platform 34 and build-tools 34.0.0, then point `sdk.dir` in `local.properties` (or `ANDROID_HOME`)
at the SDK.

## Build and install

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The debug build installs as Kinetica DEV beside the release app, with its own data.

### Release build

Release APKs are signed with a local keystore that never enters version control. Once:

```bash
mkdir -p keystore
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore keystore/kinetica-release.keystore \
  -alias kinetica -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
cat > keystore.properties <<EOF
storeFile=keystore/kinetica-release.keystore
storePassword=<your store password>
keyAlias=kinetica
keyPassword=<your key password>
EOF
```

Then:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

Without `keystore.properties`, `assembleRelease` builds an unsigned APK.

The prediction engine is pure Kotlin and tested on the JVM, including golden decodes against the
real dictionaries:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Architecture

```
MotionEvent
   -> KeyboardView          touch routing: letters to the engine, space and backspace to controllers
   -> GestureEngine         up to two pointer streams, tap or swipe decided at lift
   -> InputToken            TapToken (anchor) | SwipeToken (resampled path + key contacts)
   -> WordComposer          the word's tokens, decoded on a dedicated thread
   -> WordPredictor         merge orders -> trie search per thumb -> DTW -> ranked candidates
   -> KineticaIME           commit-only text model through InputConnection, the bar, autocorrect
```

| `onboarding/` | The enable flow and the two-thumb tutor |

### Algorithm notes

- **Coordinates** are in key widths, so density, height and layout mode drop out.
- **Swipe matching**: the observed path and each word's ideal path (through key centres) are
  resampled to 32 points by arc length and compared with Sakoe-Chiba banded DTW (radius 4, endpoints
  anchored and weighted, abandoned early against the current floor).
- **Candidates**: a search over a flat trie (two ints per node, children sorted, a 6-bit letter code
  so Cyrillic and Arabic fit). Taps are exact anchors; a swipe is a segment pruned by its start and
  end keys, the path's order, and an ideal-length band. A letter records every pass of the path near
  it, so a revisited letter (the second `e` of "however") still matches. DTW runs on complete words
  only.
- **Two thumbs**: tokens are ordered by contact time, and a near-tie (120 ms) also tries the swapped
  order. A further pass gives each thumb its own cursor and a short hand-back, and a best-first beam
  reads both thumbs in one search; their readings join the same ranked list.
- **Scoring**: `frequency_weight * geometric_term(d) * bigram_multiplier * personal_boost`, with
  `geometric_term(d) = 1 / (1 + min(d, 0.50))^3.75`. Inside half a key width the shape of the gesture
  is scored steeply; past it, a d=0.6 and a d=1.5 match both mean "not this shape", and frequency
  decides. The context and personal multipliers fade with the candidate's fit, so a common or
  heavily learned word cannot beat a clearly better match.
- **Accents**: the trie stores accent-folded keys per script; spellings that differ from their key
  ("senti", "sentì") carry their own frequencies and come out as separate candidates.
- Decoding runs in single-digit milliseconds on the JVM against a 100 ms budget (see
  `RealDictionaryTest`).
- **The backspace slide** shows the marked text in a chip above the key, not as a composing region in
  the editor: the text model is commit-only because composing spans behave differently from app to
  app. In password fields the chip shows bullets.

## Data sources

Regenerate a language's dictionary with
`python3 tools/generate_assets.py --lang <code>` (`--dry-run` to preview); the codes are
en, it, es, pl, cs, nl, de, fr, no, ru, uk, he and ar.

- Word frequencies: [hermitdave/FrequencyWords](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords)
  (OpenSubtitles 2018), MIT. The 50k list per language; Ukrainian from the full list.
- Word pairs: counted from the [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org) sentence corpus of each language,
  [CC BY 2.0 FR](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/fr/), attribution tatoeba.org. The same
  conversational register as the word lists. Tatoeba also decides which accent-less spellings stay
  and which German nouns are capitalized.
- Emoji: a hand-curated `assets/emoji_data.json` (478 emoji with names and keywords, up to
  Unicode 15). No ZWJ sequences, because a phone that cannot render one draws its
  parts; an emoji the phone's font cannot draw is left out.

### Open keyboard dictionaries

Considered as replacements for the OpenSubtitles word lists (July 2026):

| Project | Code licence | Dictionary data | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| [HeliBoard](https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard) | Apache-2.0 | [Helium314/aosp-dictionaries](https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries): the `main_*` lists are AOSP LatinIME dictionaries (Apache-2.0) | The import path: `wordlist.combined` with per-word frequency and flags |
| [FUTO Keyboard](https://github.com/futo-org/android-keyboard) | FUTO Source First 1.1, not OSI-open | Same terms | Rejected: incompatible with open redistribution |
| [FlorisBoard](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard) | Apache-2.0 | No frequency word lists | Nothing to import |

`tools/generate_assets.py --merge-aosp <wordlist.combined>` merges an AOSP list into a primary word
list; the same merge runs on the phone from Settings > Dictionary, written to app storage and loaded
in place of the bundled list. Abbreviations, offensive entries and spellings that drop a bundled
word's accents are left out. The bundled lists stay OpenSubtitles and Tatoeba: AOSP's Italian list,
merged in, decoded worse in the project's tests. An AOSP merge is Apache-2.0; this section is its
notice.

### Personal weighting

`personal_boost = 1 + 0.15 * ln(1 + personal_count)`, weighted by the candidate's fit like every
other multiplier.

- Every commit adds to the word's count for its language; counts never mix across languages. A
  correction on the bar moves the count to the replacement.
- 20 commits (`1 + 0.15 * ln(21) = 1.46`) overturn the frequency gap between a common word and a
  middling one; the logarithm keeps any one word from taking over.
- Badges show up to 7 dots; each tier doubles the count (1, 2, 4 ... 64), which matches the
  logarithm. A slide on the bar moves one tier per step.
- Learned words merge into the trie at load, so a word the dictionary lacks becomes a full
  candidate.
